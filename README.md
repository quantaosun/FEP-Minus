## Here comes FEP-Minus

It is crazy to imagine how expensive the commercial-free-energy-calculation software FEP Plus is. Well, it is not crazy for you until it is, especially for financially poor background people or groups.

The calculation logic is the same as the commercial version, so the accuracy is the same.

This notebook can allow you directly run an FEP calculation in the free Google Colab (Free, at least at the time this was created, but I know things are getting weird since Colab decided to count hours now to force you to pay for GPU).


A typical calculation for a protein with 300 to 400 amino acids could finish within 8 hours with a Tesla V100. Suppose you can not use the free GPU from Google Colab, which is volatile over time, user to user. Please spend the money of a cup of coffee to buy 10 hours of GPU. It is nothing compared to your cost for each job using commercial software.

## Pre-condition. Apply Desmond from the D.E.Shaw research group.

## FEP-Minus can also be run on any cloud platform with a good GPU, the only thing you need to change is the ```USER``` environment variable of that platform when you compile the software to that platform.
